This movie has been shown countless times in Movie channels and I think even now the public love and the TV producers keep repeating the movie again and again. I personally have watched the entire movie more than 80 -100 times and I still love it.....<br /><br />The performance by both Aamir khan as Amar and Salman khan as Prem is mind blowing but i especially liked the performance of Aamir khan as a street smart guy....his dialogs in the movie are Hilarious... the story is simple and heres how it goes.....<br /><br />Amar and Prem are poor , lazy chaps and come from a poor family of tailors and Amars father is a barber. Then they both get a news that a Millionaire 's daughter from London is coming to India to look for a suitable match ...both Amar and Prem think that this is a brilliant opportunity to become super rich.....therefore they both head out to woo Raveena Tandon..(the millionaires daughter)......in their journey they both hate each other and each one of them try to fool the other in order to marry Raveena.....the comedy scenes in between are so hilarious that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach by laughing.......and then there is Raveenas Uncle (Millionaire's look alike brother) Teja who wants to take revenge from Raveenas father.....since he is broke and Raveenas dad is a millionaire......his plans include kidnapping Raveena to blackmail Raveenas dad for which he hires 2 butlers.....<br /><br />but later on we get to know that there is a twist in the movie (watch the movie to know).......then there is Shakti Kapoor as crime master Gogo who is also incredibly funny......<br /><br />The thing which stood out for me were the dialogs in the movie which has become a legend of sorts.....Aamir khan uses his  ' aaila  '  brilliantly and Salman goes like  ' OOima  ' ........and for Gogo there is  '  Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain to Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi to Gogo Aa Jaega '  ......each and every scene is so funny......<br /><br />I especially liked the one in which Aamir khan and Salman goto get Raveena from Teja and they both go in a Luna having  ' chillar '  money in a bag....that scene is so funny..<br /><br />I recommend anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie ......this is one movie that I would recommend having a DVD and you will never regret......\",\n",

    "ARTICLE = \"Andaz Apna Apna is considered one of the most intelligent comedies ever made in Bollywood, potentially rivaling even Hollywood comedies. Despite being a commercial flop upon release, the film gained immense popularity over time, making significant revenue through home media sales and repeated TV broadcasts. The reviewer shares their personal experience, having watched the film more than 80 times and still loving it. The story follows Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan), two lazy, poor men who dream of becoming rich by marrying Raveena, the daughter of a millionaire. Both set off to woo her, engaging in hilarious schemes to outsmart each other. Alongside their antics, the movie introduces Teja, Raveena’s uncle who plots to kidnap her for ransom, and Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor), a memorable villain known for his comedic dialogues. The film’s standout elements are its witty dialogues, such as Aamir’s iconic 'aaila' and Salman’s 'ooima,' which have become legendary. The reviewer highlights memorable scenes, especially one where Amar and Prem attempt to rescue Raveena with a bag of small change. They strongly recommend this timeless comedy classic to anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu, calling it a must-have DVD for guaranteed entertainment.\""
